Collaborative information analysis involves strategic analysis and representation of complex information space over extended time periods. Current tools do not fully support workflows of information analysis, or do not support collaboration at all. We developed \emph{CAnalytics} to address two critical challenges: to support data modeling and data analysis within an integrated workspace, and to maintain activity awareness in a complex interface. We conducted a classroom study of student analysts using the tool over multiple usage sessions. The results suggest positive evidence of awareness support and an all-in-one environment . We also observe the distinction between accretion and filtering in data modeling, different approaches to information uncertainty in artifact analysis, as well as different collaboration strategies. Given these results, we suggest several design implications for collaborative information analysis tools.
