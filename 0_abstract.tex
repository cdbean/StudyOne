Information analysis involves dynamic modeling and visual exploration of complex
information spaces, and is fundamentally collaborative at any non-trivial scale.
That said, the tools supporting information analysis either do not support such
dynamic workflows, or they do not support collaboration at all. Along these
lines, we developed \emph{CAnalytics} to address these critical challenges
by: enabling interleaving of data modeling and analysis within a single interactive visualization
workspace; and supporting collaboration through shared annotation and increased
activity awareness. This paper describes a classroom study of
analysts-in-training and examines their tool usage over multiple usage sessions.
We report an interleaved work pattern that involves constant switching between data modeling and analysis. We also explore momentums that drive such switching and design opportunities that may support it further at a team level.
