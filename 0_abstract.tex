Information analysis involves dynamic modeling and exploration of complex
information spaces, and is fundamentally collaborative at any non-trivial scale.
That said, the tools supporting information analysis either do not support such
dynamic workflows, or they do not support collaboration at all. Along these
lines, we developed \emph{CAnalytics} to address these two critical challenges
by: enabling interleaving of data modeling and analysis within a single
workspace; and supporting collaboration through shared annotation and increased
activity awareness. This paper describes a classroom study of
analysts-in-training and examines their tool usage over multiple usage sessions.
We report the interleaving work patterns students spontaneously employed with our
tool, as well as the analytic behaviors that drive the interleaving pattern. We also
note the distinctions among collaborative strategies, and project improved
awareness design to enable a more interleaving workflow.
