Intelligence analysis involves dynamic modeling and exploration of complex information spaces, and is fundamentally collaborative at any non-trivial
scale. That said, the tools supporting intelligence analysis either do not
support such dynamic workflows, or they do not support collaboration at all.
Along these lines, we developed \emph{CAnalytics} to address these two critical
challenges by: enabling interleaving of data modeling and analysis within a single
workspace; and supporting collaboration through shared annotation and increased
activity awareness. This paper describes a classroom study of students training to
become intelligence analysts and examines their tool usage over multiple usage
sessions. We report the interleaving work patterns students spontaneously employ with our tool, as well as effect of the collaboration features on their teamwork. We also note the
distinctions among different analytic and collaborative strategies. The paper concludes with
design implications for intelligence analysis as well as other collaborative information analysis tools.
