\section{Conclusion}

This study investigates the feasibility, effectiveness and consequence of
supporting collaborative information analysis in the context of classroom study.
Our study provides encouraging results on design of an integrated collaborative
workspace. Analysts spontaneously employed an interleaving workflow and making
use of awareness features provided by the tool to stay team awareness. We also
identify new opportunities in awareness support; awareness includes not only
team actions, but information uncertainty, contribution visibility, and context
for insight sharing. We propose design implications to enable a more
interleaving workflow and possibly at a team level.

While this study was performed with an emphasis on intelligence analysis, we argue that CAnalytics can also be utilized for a broader domain of collaborative information analysis, wherein a team examines a complex information space of facts and relationships. As collaborative information analysis is increasingly a typical and chronic task, it is important for research to examine, understand, and provide effective tools and environments for these long-term, real-world CSCW interactions. This requires situating research in more complex work activity contexts, and directly investigating interactions, experiences, and outcomes in those contexts.




% Meanwihle, due to the nature of classroom study, a lot of variables that cannot be factored could influence the result. For example, students coordinated teamwork not only through CAnalytics but also through face-to-face meeting. What the teams did outside CAnalytics is not collected, which obviously influenced team performance. But our work provides a realistic picture of usage of a collaborative tool in real world, and poses several design questions and hypotheses, which could be investigated in future controlled lab studies.

%Since the study was conducted in a naturalist environment, participants were not observed in a controlled lab, and they were free to choose either face-to-face collaboration settings or remote work settings, and they could also use any other tools they preferred. Thus their high rating of awareness in the survey is not a sufficient proof of the success of the tool. Still, their answer in the open-ended questionnaire explained to some extent how the tool helped achieve the function.
