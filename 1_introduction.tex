\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Intelligence analysis is a form of sensemaking wherein a team of analysts 
identify and evaluate causal relationships in a complex corpus of documents. A 
common example of such an analysis is the investigation of a crime, where a variety of putative facts are assembled, e.g.
financial records, witness observations and interviews, and the social
connections between persons of interest. Armed with these different assembled facts
 investigators collaboratively: assess means, motives,
and opportunities; articulate and investigate further hypotheses and deductions;
and develop one or more theories of the crime.

% point first, and be more explicit about how it forces you into that model.} 

According to Pirolli and Card's model \cite{Pirolli2005}, intelligence analysis starts with modeling data from textual documents, followed by representing these data models in various information artifacts, and developing them into hypotheses. 
Systems that currently support intelligence analysis
are aimed at a single phase and therefore only support part of the overall analysis workflow.
This imposes a clear boundary between each of these phases on the analysts. For example, the Analysis of
Competing Hypotheses (ACH) tool assumes that data has been modeled, and that relevant
evidence can be adduced appropriately to various hypotheses, but provides no
structured support for either. Other techniques, such as Information Extraction
and Weighting (IEW), help structure evidence modeling, but do not extend
utilization of evidence to hypothesis generation. The unintended boundary between phases has the consequence that
data modeled in one software cannot be effectively utilized in hypothesis
development in another system. And analysts have to handoff, often via replicating the data in the new system, information between software systems, making it difficult to revisit and revise the data model. We
therefore are motivated to develop an integrated workspace in which analysts can
model and analyze data in one place, and we utilize the system as an
experimental instrument to investigate analytic behavior afforded by such
integration.

% \bvh{Talk about how it is collaborative.} \bvh{Although I get lost in what you
% are trying to do in the end of this paragraph...I am not sure what point you are
% trying to make. This is the most confusing part of the intro so far}
Any intelligence analysis activity, at least at a non-trivial scale, is
fundamentally collaborative \cite{Convertino2011}. The intelligence community 
puts great value on collaboration. A report from the Director of National Intelligence, 
\emph{Vision 2015},  called for \emph{``a dramatic shift from traditional emphasis on 
self-reliance toward more collaborative operations''} \cite[p.13]{Vision2015}. 
However, most analytic tools that are widely used in the intelligence community 
(e.g.~Analyst's Notebook \cite{IBM} and PARC ACH \cite{PARC}) do not support 
collaboration. The community has to rely on separate collaboration tools (e.g.~email, Intellipedia \cite{Intelink2017}), which lack serious support for analytics, for team coordination \cite{Treverton2016}. Thus, analysts must coordinate their work outside 
of their tool support, manually sharing their analytic products. 

Supporting collaboration in intelligence analysis is challenging, and perhaps more than other situations (e.g.~collaborative writing, wiki) because the task itself can be extremely complex. A team could be working with much more complex data structure (e.g.~spatial data,
temporal data, and relational data, as opposed to text only), coordinating
through multiple analytic artifacts (e.g.~map, timeline, network, as opposed to
only document only), and making sense of different levels of analysis, assumptions,
and hypotheses, both synchronously and asynchronously throughout a long-term
course of collaborative interaction. This study aims to investigate how technology
can mediate team collaboration in a sufficiently complex analytic task over
multiple usage sessions.


%\bvh{Talk about what we did, this makes sense.} 
We performed our study within
the context of an intelligence analysis course. This classroom study provides a
natural environment in which participants engage in multi-session, relatively
complex class projects. Due to the difficulty in accessing professional
analysts, or having them in longitudinal design loops,
\emph{analysts-in-training} are a good compromise. These students already have
some knowledge and experience with state-of-the-art analytic techniques and
tools. In class projects, students are graded on their ability to understand and
enact the professional practices of information analysis. This strong normative
emphasis on problem solving practices provides us an appropriate evaluation context for new
interactive tools: Tools are only valuable to the students insofar as they
actually support better practices and better outcomes.

%\bvh{you don't call out to the strategies part of the analysis here} 
We are thus
motivated to investigate the feasibility, effectiveness and consequence of
supporting collaborative intelligence analysis in the context of classroom study
%\bvh{I think this sentence is unnecessary}. 
We have developed a tool that
includes annotation for data modeling, interactive visualization for data
analysis, and a set of collaboration features. Our contributions include 1) evaluating 
tool support, in particular, support for data modeling and analysis and support 
for collaboration, in a classroom environment; 2) identifying collaboration 
characteristics and issues in team process; and 3) suggesting design 
implications for future collaborative intelligence analysis support.
